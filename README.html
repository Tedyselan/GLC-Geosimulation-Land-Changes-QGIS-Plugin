# Geosimulation Land Changes

**Geosimulation Land Changes** is a tool used in spatial modeling to predict changes in land cover or land use. In the context of land prediction, 
this plugin applies the principles of Cellular Automata Markov Chain, which is a grid-based dynamic system, where each cell on the grid represents a certain unit of space and has a certain status. 
Each cell will change its state according to certain rules based on the state of the surrounding cells or its neighbors. 

## List of Tools

## Transition Probability
The transition probability is calculated by analyzing the frequency of change of a particular land use over a time interval.
