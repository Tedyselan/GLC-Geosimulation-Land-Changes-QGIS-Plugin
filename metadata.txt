about=Plugin Geosimulation Land Changes is a tool used in spatial modeling to predict changes in land cover or land use. In the context of land cover prediction, this plugin applies the principles of Cellular Automata Markov Chain, which is a grid-based dynamic system, where each cell on the grid represents a certain unit of space and has a certain status (e.g. forest, settlement, farmland). Each cell will change its state according to certain rules based on the state of the surrounding cells or its neighbors. This plugin helps in performing predictive modeling that provides more realistic outputs.
